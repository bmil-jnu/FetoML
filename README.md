# FetoML

Title: FetoML: Interpretable predictions of the fetotoxicity of drugs based on machine learning approaches

Authors: Myeonghyeon Jeong, Sunyong Yoo

## Description

We present FetoML, a model that can provide interpretable predictions of fetal toxicity of drugs using various machine learning approaches.
You can find the data and source code used in the paper.
In addition, we provide a Python file that can be used to generate predictions from the model we trained.
